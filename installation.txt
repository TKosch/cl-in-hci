To preserve anonymity, we are providing the source of the webpage we have built to examine the publications we coded. We will create a public URL prior to publication.

Running the webpage locally requires Node and Node Package Manager (npm).

Open up a terminal application. Install http-server as a global package: npm install http-server -g

Change your directory to this folder. Once in this folder, run: http-server website

This will start the webpage running locally on port 8080. Open it in your browser by navigating to: http://localhost:8080
