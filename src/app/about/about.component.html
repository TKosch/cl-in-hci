		    <p>This project is a living repository of papers relevant to <a href="http://personalinformatics.org">Personal Informatics</a>, a research area which examines technology people use for self-understanding. This repository was originally developed for a literature review mapping research contributions in the literature:</p>

			<p>If you use this repository in your own work, please cite this paper.</p>
		    <p>If you wish to add a paper to the repository, you can suggest it by filling out our <a href="/article">Google Form</a>. We require all indexed publications be peer reviewed, in English, archival, and relevant to personal informatics. Typical publication venues include (but are not limited to) CHI, IMWUT, PervasiveHealth, and CSCW. The <a href="https://depstein.net/pielab">PIE Lab</a> at University of California, Irvine manages the paper list.</p>
		    <p>Corrections or additions to included publications are also welcome. Our IMWUT paper's <a href="http://depstein.net/assets/docs/imwut20_supplemental.zip">supplemental material</a> has more information about how we defined each label to ensure consistency. However, we are very open to making edits or adding labels we may have missed. Labeling of papers is inherently reductive, but potentially helpful helpful for gaining an understanding of the field's patterns of study.</p>
			<p>Any questions about the paper list or the repository can be sent to <a href="http://depstein.net/">Daniel Epstein</a>. Development of this website was led by Daniel Epstein, with assistance from Simran Ahuja, Payam Dowlatyari, and Sazeda Sultana. The website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/depstein/personalinformatics-metareview">GitHub</a>.
